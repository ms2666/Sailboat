SUMMARY: Blended vector sea surface winds (at 10-m above sea level) and 
	surface windstresses (stresses felt by the water). The wind speeds
	are blended from multiple satellites [up to six, including 
	Scatterameters (QuikSCAT), SSMIs, TMI and AMSR-E] observations, 
	on a global 0.25-degree grid and time resolution of 6-hourly, as 
	four 'instantaneous' global snapshots per day at UTC/GMT 00, 06,
	12 and 18Z. The blended speeds are then decomposed into (u,v) 
	components using the NCEP Re-analysis 2 (NRA-2) wind directions 
	interpolated onto the blended speed grid. The 6-hourly (u,v) 
	instantaneous fields are provided at our data site, and the speed
	itself can be simply computed as w=(u^2+v^2)^0.5, which is exactly 
	the blended speed from the multiple satellites.
	
	Daily fields are also provided as simple avearges in time of the 
	6-hourly data, and monthly fields are provided as averages of the 
	daily fields. Because the vector means do not exactly equal to the 
	scalar/speed means, the scalar means are thus also provided in the
	daily and monthly datasets, as (u,v,w). The scalar/speed means 
	correspond to the means of the blended speed from mutiple satellite
	speed observations, and may be useful for wind energy indistries 
	as an example. The vector means can be computed as the magnitude of 
	the mean u and v, and may be useful for oceanographers as an example.
	
	Computations for the wind stresses follow the same methodology. 
	Particularly in this version, the 6-hourly satellite-scaled global 
	0.25-degree grid wind stresses are computed as:
	   	taux_s = -[(w_s/w_m)**2]*taux_m
   		tauy_s = -[(w_s/w_m)**2]*tauy_m 
	where '_s' indicates satellite-scaled values and '_m' indicates 
	NRA-2 model values interpolated to the satellite grid. Wind speeds
	are at the time stamps and taux/y are 6-hour averages starting from
	the time stamps.
	 
	The satellite wind speed blending scheme is a Gaussian like 3-D 
	(in x,y,t) interpolation. To reduce the data gaps for the early years
	(when fewer satellite were available) and to reduce aliases for the
	instantaneous fields for the later years (when more satellites are 
	availabe), the time window and spatial radiaus are chosen as 
	+/- 6 hours and 62.5 km, respectively. Sampling feasibility study can
	be found at http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2006/2006GL027086.shtml

	Products are available from 09 July 1987 - present. The 6-hourly 4 
	snapshots per day are at UTC 00, 06, 12 and 18Z. The center time of the
	daily averages is thus UTC 09Z. The grid cells are: 
	lon=0.0:0.25:359.75 (im=1440)
        lat=-89.75:0.25:89.75 (jm=719)

********************************
DATA DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

./seawinds/SI/ contains topographic data & reading program (<0 below sea level).

Subdirectories ./uv/ and ./stress/ under ./seawinds/SI/ contains the 
vector winds and windstress, respectively:

---------------
./uv/ 			contains the vector winds, with sub-directories for 
			different time resolutions of 
    ./uv/6hrly/ [6-hourly, 4 global snapshots (u,v) at UTC 00, 06, 12 and 18Z]
    ./uv/daily/  [averages of the above 4 time points, thus with a center time 09Z;
    		  also provided is the scalar mean, (u,v,w)]
    ./uv/monthly/ [averages of the above daily data; also provided is the 
    			scalar mean, (u,v,w)]
    ./uv/clm/ [climatological monthlies; also provided is the 
    			scalar mean, (u,v,w)]
			
	         For each of the time resolutions, there are two subdirectories 
		 that contains data in netCDF and IEEE - big endian, such as:
   ./uv/6hrly/netcdf/
   ./uv/6hrly/ieee/	(same for the ./daily/ and ./monthly/ datasets)
	
		Then under each data format-subdirectory, the data are organized by 
		decades for the 6-hourly and daily data, such as
   ./uv/6hrly/netcdf/1980s/
   ./uv/6hrly/netcdf/1990s/
   ./uv/6hrly/netcdf/2000s/	(same for the ./ieee/ data)
   
    		The data file names are in the formats of
		uvYYYYMMDD.nc (or .be) for the 6-hourly and daily data, and 
		uvYYYYMM.nc (or .be) for the monthly data. 
		
		Support reading routines are included in the time-resolution
		subdirectories [read*.f (FORTRAN), read*.m (MATLAB), W*.gs (GrADS), etc],
		with verification data in text (verify_SI_uv_6hrly.txt, etc); 
		these files are self-explaining.
			
./stress/ has the same sub-dir structures as ./uv/.

HISTORY - reverse chronically:

Addition of Near-Real-Time (NRT) Product (1 March 2008):
A version of NRT (about 1-day delay) Blended Sea Winds is produced quasi-daily at the 
requests of some users. Automatic daily updates run for most days; however, this is not
a 24/7 operation service, and updates are deplayed occasionally due to machine maintenance
downtime, etc. The NRT vector winds are blended from the NRT satellite wind speed retrievals
from the Remote Sensing System (RSS) and wind directions from the ECMWF NWP forecast 
(ftp://eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov/raid1b/surfa). The NRT data are replaced by the delayed-mode 
research quality data (Version 1.2) on monthly basis. The data archive locations are the 
same for the NRT and Reserach Quality (Ver 1.2), with the name conventions
uv20080101rt.nc (rt = near-real-time) and uv20080101.nc, respectively.


Version 1.2 (July 2007):
The wind speeds/magnitudes are the same as Version 1.1 (blended only from satllite data).
However, wind directions are shifted by 6-hours in time in the NRA-2 renalysis fields, 
thus affects the decompositions of wind speeds into the u-v components. It was found that
the 'time stamps' in the NRA-2 output files are not for the fields themselves, but they 
are the forecast starting time, or as the 'reference times'. The output fields themselves
are 6-hour forecasts valid for the times 6-hours after the 'reference times' for winds etc
and 6-hour averages for flux fields. These are taken into account in this new version 
(Version 1.2) of the blended fields, and are valid as 'instantaneous' snapshots at the 
time 'stamps' imbedded in the netCDF files for the wind speeds and u-v components.

Version 1.1 (April 2007):
1) This version used the individual satellite retrievals from the Remote Sensing System,
Inc (http://www.remss.com/) that were released in September 2006. 

2) Vector winds and windstresses are provided in this version, with the wind speed from
blending the multiple satellite observations and wind direction from the NCEP 
Reanalysis-2 interpolated to the blended satellite speed grid. 

3) To save storage space, the 6-hourly (4 instantaneous global snapshots per day) data 
only contain the (u,v) components, since the speed/magnitude can be computed as 
sqrt(u^2+v^2) for the instantaneous field, which is exactly the blended speed from the 
multiple satellites. However, for the (daiyly/monthly) mean speed, there are commonly 
two ways to compute the means, as vector mean or scalar mean, and they generally do not
equal to each other. For comparison purpose, the scalar mean speed (w) is also provided
together with means of the (u,v) components in the daily and monthly mean fields [i.e. 
as (u,v,w) or (taux,tauy,tau)]. The scalar means correspond to the means of blended 
satellite wind speed.


Version 1.0 (August 2006):
This version used the individual satellite retrievals from the Remote Sensing System,
Inc (http://www.remss.com/) before their major updates in September 2006. Also, only 
wind speed data were provided for the 6-hourly, daily and monthly resolutions. This 
version was moved offsite and can be obtained by the above 'CONTACTS'.

(Note versioned - 12-hourly or lower resolution, 2005)
